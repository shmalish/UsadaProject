# Introduction
Hello everyone who is reading this blog. The purpose of this blog is to research every drug in the USADA banned list to see why it is banned. The reason I want to explore this is because I'm a nerd. Not the type of nerd who watches movies and stuff, but the nerd who loves to learn and is heavily into their health and fitness. 

The reason the USADA banned list interests me so much is because I want to know why a substance is able to improve performance so much, it warrants a ban. I also want to know why the substances are bad for your health (I imagine that this is a very big factor when it comes to banning a substance for athletes).

I decided to start researching PED's when I was in Sixth Form. Not because I wanted to take them (right away), but more so how they work and what they actually do. One day I went to my PE teachers office and I asked them what they think about SARMs as I am considering utilising them as a Quasi Hormone replacement therapy when my own natural testosterone levels start to decline with age (~ 30 years old probably). Luckily, my PE teachers were actually smart and while all the information they told me about side effects went through one ear and out of the other, one teacher (Mr Fahey) raised an excellent point. He told me that when you take a PED, your body adapts very quickly to the increase in performance you achieve. And even when you come off of those drugs, your body still has those adaptations which will not be fair whenever you are competing in a natural competition. This point I never thought of and it made me question in my mind "what qualifies a substance to be a banned PED?". Another teacher, Mr Manstle, also made to check up on me randomly asking if I was taking steroids lol. (Also them people snitched on me because how is Mr Green asking to speak to me the next day and telling me Steroids are illegal???? Eh fair enough)

So, I present this blog post to find the answer to my questions, do some learning and have some fun!
