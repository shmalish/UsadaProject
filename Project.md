# Introduction
Hello everyone who is reading this blog. The purpose of this blog is to research every drug in the USADA banned list to see why it is banned. The reason I want to explore this is because I'm a nerd. Not the type of nerd who watches movies and stuff, but the nerd who loves to learn and is heavily into their health and fitness. 

The reason the USADA banned list interests me so much is because I want to know why a substance is able to improve performance so much, it warrants a ban. I also want to know why the substances are bad for your health (I imagine that this is a very big factor when it comes to banning a substance for athletes).

I decided to start researching PED's when I was in Sixth Form. Not because I wanted to take them (right away), but more so how they work and what they actually do. One day I went to my PE teachers office and I asked them what they think about SARMs as I am considering utilising them as a Quasi Hormone replacement therapy when my own natural testosterone levels start to decline with age (~ 30 years old probably). Luckily, my PE teachers were actually smart and while all the information they told me about side effects went through one ear and out of the other, one teacher (Mr Fahey) raised an excellent point. He told me that when you take a PED, your body adapts very quickly to the increase in performance you achieve. And even when you come off of those drugs, your body still has those adaptations which will not be fair whenever you are competing in a natural competition. This point I never thought of and it made me question in my mind "what qualifies a substance to be a banned PED?". Another teacher, Mr Manstle, also made to check up on me randomly asking if I was taking steroids lol. (Also them people snitched on me because how is Mr Green asking to speak to me the next day and telling me Steroids are illegal???? Eh fair enough)

So, I present this blog post to find the answer to my questions, do some learning and have some fun! 

# Chapter 1 - Anabolic Agents

## Androstenediol (5…ë-androst-1-ene-3√ü,17√ü-diol)

RX list describes Androstendiol as an oral steroid which increases testosterone in the body. However, apparently, this substance is ineffective for performance enhancements as rx list states that it doesn't seem to help much with what you want testosterone to do which is to make your muscles larger and stronger. Nor does it seem to increase libido and energy. 


The side effect on androstnediol seems to be basically the same side effects as using testosterone which makes sense. 

This substance is a metabolite of DHEA so basically a couple steps before testosterone which is why it increases testosterone in the body.

## Androstenedione

Basically the same thing as Androstenediol, just weaker. Doesn't really make your muscles bigger or stronger.

## 1-Testosterone 

Very high androgenic and anabolic potency. It binds to androgen receptors. 

### Mechanism of action
It binds to the androgen receptor. Once bound, the receptor/ligand complex localises to the nucleus and acts as a DNA binding transcription factor, regulating gene expression. I am not going to pretend I know what any of this means so below will be an AI explanation. 
Certainly! Let‚Äôs break it down:

1. Delta1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT): This is a type of hormone.
2. Androgen receptor (AR): Think of this as a ‚Äúlock‚Äù on the surface of certain cells.
3. Testosterone and DHT: These are other hormones that can ‚Äúfit‚Äù into the AR lock.
4. Once bound: When DHT attaches to the AR, they form a complex.
Localizes to the nucleus: The complex moves into the cell‚Äôs control center (the nucleus).
Acts as a DNA binding transcription factor: Inside the nucleus, it influences which genes get turned on or off.
5. In simpler terms, DHT interacts with the AR, enters the cell‚Äôs nucleus, and helps control gene activity. üòä12
